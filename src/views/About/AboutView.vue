      <p class="mb-3">
        Japan is a beautiful country, filled with some of the greatest entertainment, views and
        cuisine experiences offered nowhere else on the planet. Unfortunately, it is also a land of
        etiquette and manners that keeps you at arm's length.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-3">
        What should you pay attention to while you are in Japan? Where do you even begin to learn
        these unspoken rules? We at Japuri would like to solve that.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-3">
        Through input from both locals and tourists like yourselves. Japuri would like to bridge the
        gap to create a more welcoming Japan.
