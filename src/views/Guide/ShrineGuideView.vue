    <p>
      Shrines are sacred spaces dedicated to a god. Shrines are places to pray for good fortune,
      give thanks, and connect with Japan’s gods. Common features include torii (gates),
      purification fountains, and the main worship hall (haiden).

      <li>Bow once before passing through the torii gates</li>
      <li>
        There’s Temizuya (Purification Ritual) where you must cleanse your hands and mouth. First,
        use the ladle to pour water over your left hand, then your right hand. After that, pour
        water into your left hand to rinse your mouth (but don’t swallow it). Finally, let the
        remaining water flow down the handle before placing the ladle back.
      </li>
      <li>
        At the offering box (saisenbako), follow this: Bow twice. Clap twice. Say your prayer
        silently. Bow once to conclude.  * If you’re at a Temple, don’t do this sequence. It’s only
        for Shrines.
      </li>
      <li>
        Try to visit Shrines before 4pm. There’s a legend that the god leaves the shrine after 4pm
        so usually Japanese people try to visit shrines early.
