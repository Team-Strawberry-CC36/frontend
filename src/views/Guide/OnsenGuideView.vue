    <p class="text-gray-800 leading-7 mb-4">
      Japan’s onsens are not just baths but are deeply tied to Japanese culture, relaxation, and
      health. Onsens are a cornerstone of Japanese tradition, with mineral hot springs believed to
      have healing properties. Historically, onsens were places for communal cleansing and bonding.

    <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-3 text-gray-700">
      <li>
        Use showering to wash your body thoroughly before soaking. Onsens prioritize cleanliness.
      </li>
      <li>
        Towels are allowed and should not touch the water. Place them on your head or on the side of
        the onsen.
      </li>
      <li>Speak in a low voice and avoid loud conversations.</li>
      <li>
        Don’t splash or disturb other people. Avoid submerging your head in the water, as it’s
        considered unhygienic.
