    <p>
      Japan’s onsens are not just baths but are deeply tied to Japanese culture, relaxation, and
      health. Onsens are a cornerstone of Japanese tradition, with mineral hot springs believed to
      have healing properties. Historically, onsens were places for communal cleansing and bonding.
